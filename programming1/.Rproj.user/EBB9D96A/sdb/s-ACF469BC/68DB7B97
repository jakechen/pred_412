    "contents" : "1. Introduction\n===============\nWith the Wine dataset we will be applying a supervised learning to predict the class of the unknown wine. In this initial project we will perform an EDA on the dataset to understand the distributions of the variables with the context of classification in mind.\n\n2. Procedure & Analysis\n=======================\n2.1 Data import\n---------------\nFirst we begin by loading the data. \n```{r}\nlibrary(MMST)\ndata(wine)\n```\n\n2.2 Summary EDA\n---------------\nLet's begin the EDA process by performing a quick viewing and summary reports on the entire dataset.\n```{r}\nhead(wine)\nstr(wine)\nsummary(wine)\n```\n**Analysis**  \nWhat we see is quite straight-forward and expected. Here are some important highlights we can gather about the data:\n- Str() function:\n  - There are 15 variables in the dataset\n  - The last 2 variable are the categorical classifiers that we are modeling for. R has already set them to the \"factor\" datatype for us.\n  - There are \n- Summary() function:\n  - There are no missing values in our data. \n  - The magnitudes in the variables vary from single digits to thousands.\n  - The dataset is relatively well distributed between the classes.\n\n2.3 Graphical EDA\n-----------------\nNow that we have completed a cursory summary EDA of our dataset, we move on with a graphical EDA on the datasets. This step of the EDA will hopefully provide us a better understanding of the variables in terms of their individual distributions as well as their mutual relationships. \n\n### 2.3.1 Univariate EDA\nFirst let's perform a univariate EDA to understand the variables as a whole. We can do this by **looking at a histogram of each variable**.\n```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}\nfor(i in 1:(ncol(wine)-2)){\n  hist(wine[,i], xlab=names(wine)[i], main=paste('Histogram of', names(wine)[i]))\n}\n```\n**Analysis**  \nFrom this quick initial analysis we can see that there are **some variables that seem to be normally distributed as well as some variables that could be log-normally distributed**. For example, Alcohol, AlcAsh, and Proa seem to be relatively normally distributed. On the other hand, MalicAcid, Mg, and Color may benefit from a log transformation.\n\n### 2.3.2 Bivariate EDA\nWith a univariate EDA completed, we move on to multivariate EDA to look at the relationship between variables. Because the purpose of this project is classification, we begin by looking at each explanatory variable in relation to the target variable. Instead of histograms, this time we will use **Kernel Density Estimation broken down by wine class**. We'll also adjust the opacity of the estimates to make the overlapping regions more visible. To create these graphics we will turn to the **ggplot2** package.\n```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nfor(i in 1:(ncol(wine)-2)){\n  p <- ggplot(wine, aes(x=wine[,i], fill=class)) +\n    geom_density(aes(alpha=0.5)) +\n    labs(x=names(wine)[i])\n  print(p)\n}\n```\n**Analysis**  \nAlready we can see some great breakdowns in the data that could be useful in classifying wines. For example:\n- \"Flav\" and \"OD\" have great separation between \"Barbera\" and \"Barolo\" classes.\n- \"Color\" has decent separation between \"Grignolino\" and the others.\n\nSome variables will likely be useless in classification. For example \"Ash\" and \"Mg\" could be potentially bad candidates.\n\n3. Conclusion & Next Steps\n==========================\nSome primary takeaways from this EDA include:\n- Univariate EDA shows variables that could benefit from log transformations.\n  - *I did try this later and it didn't do much. See appendices.*\n- Bivariate EDA points out some variables with clear breakdowns between the classes.\n  - \"Barbera\" and \"Barolo\" classes are can be easily separated via the \"Flav\" and \"OD\" variables.\n  - The \"Grignolino\" class can be separated out via the \"Color\" variable, but the split is not nearly as clean as the others.\n\nBased on these results, we feel that it is worthwhile to move forward with classification algorithms. There are clear enough breakdowns just in this initial EDA that more sophisticated algorithms should be able to perform the classification task successfully.\n\n4. Appendices\n=============\n4.1 Additional analysis\n-----------------------\n### Does a log transformation on Color do anything?\n```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}\nwine$l_Color <- log(wine$Color)\np <- ggplot(wine, aes(x=l_Color, fill=class)) +\n  geom_density(aes(alpha=0.5)) +\n  labs(x=names(wine)[i])\nprint(p)\n```\nApparently it does not.\n",
